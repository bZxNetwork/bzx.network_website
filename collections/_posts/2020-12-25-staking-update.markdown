Dear bZx Community,

Despite our developer teams’ hard work to get the staking platform ready before the end of the year and getting the necessary audits in time, we have decided to postpone the launch by a few weeks.

It’s important for us to make clear that, although we could have pulled through with the launch, we took this decision to show that we listened to the feedback we received from the community.
We have been criticized for releasing products previously that haven't met expectations and we are working to avoid that from occurring again.

There were improvements we wanted to make, additional tests we wanted to undertake and feedback we received, which we simply couldn’t ignore. On the bright side, the staking platform will be better than ever once it is fully live and our community will benefit from it.  

Meanwhile we would love to hear your thoughts and questions relating to the staking platform in our [forum.](https://forum.bzx.network/)

We appreciate everyone’s patience and please stay tuned!
